## Install
Clone the project.

### Dependencies
Ensure that [keybase cli](https://keybase.io/docs/the_app/install_linux) is installed and you are logged in. Verify username with:
```console
keybase whoami
```

## Usage
AWS Access Key is managed by terraform. Simply destroy and apply to rotate. Use [terraform workspaces](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/workspaces.html) for managing multiple keys.

### Setup a new key
Create a new AWS Key to be managed by terraform.
- (*conditional one-time*) Create a `terraform.tfvars` file (see [Security](#security) for more info):
    ```hcl
    pgp_key = "keybase:some_person_that_exists"
    ```
- (*optional*) Create a Terraform Workspace:
    
    **Note** : Each key is managed with a different workspace to separate state files. If not using the `default` workspace, create a new one or select an existing one.
    ```console
    terraform workspace new <name>
    ```

- Ensure the current `AWS Caller Identity` is the account you intend to manage in this workspace:
 
    **Note** : This identity is used by terraform invocations.
    ```console
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    ```

- Create a new key:

    **Note** : This helper script will run `terraform apply`, then decrypt the output with keybase.
    ```console
    ./aws-key.sh create
    ```

### Rotate a key
Rotate an existing AWS Key that is already being managed by terraform.
- Select the appropriate Terraform Workspace:

    **Note** : Each key is managed with a different workspace to separate state files. If not using the `default` workspace, create a new one or select an existing one.
    ```console
    terraform workspace select <name>
    ```

- Ensure the current `AWS Caller Identity` is the account you intend to manage in the selected workspace:
 
    **Note** : This identity is used by terraform invocations.
    ```console
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    ```

- Rotate the existing key:

    **Note** : This helper script will run `terraform destroy`, `terraform apply`, then decrypt the output with keybase.
    ```console
    ./aws-key.sh rotate
    ```

### Decrypt a key
Decrypt an existing AWS Key that is already being managed by terraform.

- Select the appropriate Terraform Workspace:

    **Note** : Each key is managed with a different workspace to separate state files. If not using the `default` workspace, create a new one or select an existing one.
    ```console
    terraform workspace select <name>
    ```

- Decrypt the existing key:

    **Note** : This helper script will get the key's `encrypted_secret` from terraform state, then decrypt with keybase.
    ```console
    ./aws-key.sh decrypt
    ```

### Import an existing key
- Create a Terraform Workspace:
    ```console
    teraform workspace new <name>
    ```
- Import the key:
    ```console
    terraform import aws_iam_access_key.key <access_key_id>
    ```

### Update key status
- Select the Terraform Workspace:
    ```console
    terraform workspace select <name>
    ```
- Update the key to inactive or active:
    ```console
    ./aws-key.sh update inactive
    ```

## Sample Output
### Rotate a key
- Select the workspace
    ```console
    teraform workspace select default
    ```
- Rotate the key
    ```shell
    $ ./aws-key.sh rotate
    Previously invoked identity (tfstate):
    {
    "account_id" = "<account-id>"
    "arn" = "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:user/mycli"

    "user_id" = "<user-id>"

- Update AWS Access Key and validate:
    ```shell
    # Update environment with new aws access key
    # Validate newly created Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
    $ aws sts get-caller-identity
    {
        "UserId": "<user-id>",
        "Account": "<account-id>",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:user/mycli"
    }
    ```

## Security
To avoid storing the secret in plaintext in `tfstate`, the secret is encrypted with a [pgp_key](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/iam_access_key#pgp_key):
> Either a base-64 encoded PGP public key, or a keybase username in the form `keybase:some_person_that_exists`, for use in the `encrypted_secret` output attribute.

**Note** : Currently, only `keybase` decryption is available with the `aws-key.sh` script.
